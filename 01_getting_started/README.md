# Getting started 

### What's this cluster thing?

When you connect to Adroit, or any of the university clusters aside
from Nobel, you are connecting to a "head node" or "login node", which is a computer
that connects to many others that are linked together for computation
called a "cluster".

The head node shares a file system with the clusters, and it is where
you should upload code, install R packages, and can allow for an 
occassional 5-10 minute test run.

For more, see [What is a Cluster?](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/faq/what-is-a-cluster).

### Slurm and where to compute

Your computational jobs must be submitted using the scheduling software
called Slurm (Simple Linux User Resource Management). It divides up the 
computing nodes and their CPUs fairly and equitably.

See our [Slurm knowledge base page](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/slurm) for more.

See a comprehensive guide on using the [Research Computing clusters](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/get-started/guide-princeton-clusters).

### Installing Packages and accessing R

The details of installing R packages can be found on our [R/RStudio knowledge base page](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/rrstudio).
