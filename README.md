# Using R on the Research Computing Clusters

### About this repo

This repository contains examples of how to use R on the Princeton Research Computing
clusters. The material is written for the Adroit cluster but it can also be used for Della.

The various examples cover how to access R,
appropriate use of Slurm and job scheduling, and some examples of how
one might parallelize code.
