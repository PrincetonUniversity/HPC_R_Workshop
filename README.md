# Using R on the Princeton HPC Clusters

## About this repo
This repository contains examples of how to use R on the Princeton HPC
clusters, using the commonly accessible Adroit as an example.

The various examples cover how to access R on Princeton University's clusters,
appropriate use of SLURM and scheduling, and some various examples of how
one might parallelize code. Each folder has notations in markdown so that 
this can easily be viewed from a website or from a clone repository on
the cluster.

<!--## Adroit Reservation
